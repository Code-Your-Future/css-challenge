# CSS challenge

## Task

Firstly fork and clone this repository. For those using the Github Desktop app please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/guides/blob/master/forking-and-cloning/README.md). For those using the command line, see if you can use the GitHub documentation to help you.

Only using the `style.css` file, style the html to look as much like this example as you can: http://www.csszengarden.com/217/

Once you're finished, commit and push your changes up to GitHub and submit a Pull Request to this repository.

## Useful Resources

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - you can import these fonts using a `<link >` tag. (Fonts are the only addition to the html file we will allow!)
